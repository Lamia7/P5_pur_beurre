# P5_pur_beurre

### Context
The startup Pur Beurre is very familiar with French food habits. Their restaurant, Ratatouille, has become increasingly popular and attracts more and more visitors to the Butte de Montmartre.

The team noticed that their users wanted to change their diet but didnâ€™t know what to start with. 

_Replace the Nutella with a hazelnut paste, yes, but which one? And in which store to buy it?_ 

Their idea is to create a program that would interact with the Open Food Facts database to retrieve the food, compare it, and provide the user with a healthier alternative to the food they crave.
